# Football-fake-news
I took a dataset from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shawkyelgendy/fake-news-football and was able to perform data preprocessing, applied stopwords and stemming
I trained the model and got a really god accuracy score
This model is being deployed using Streamlit https://fake-news-b4epnvmiqxxgbbsmgdpjyf.streamlit.app/  takes a bit time to load
